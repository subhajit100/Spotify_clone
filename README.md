# Spotify_clone
### This project consists of only the frontend part using pure HTML , CSS and JS.
#### This will play the certain set of songs according to your choice. You can do the following things while playing with it:-
1. Move the progress bar to go to that part of song.
2. Pause and play at any point, which also reflects both on main play button at bottom as well as the play button on side of each song.
3. Go to previous and next songs with the icons given at bottom.
4. The song if ended will play automatically the next song, if its the last song, then will play the first song.
5. For selecting any song to run, you have to click the small play icon at the right most position of every song container.

#### Things on UI which will help you enjoy:-
1. The playing indication bar which is visible only during the song is playing.
2. The default song is the first song, whenever you refresh the page
3. The container at the middle shows the song cover, song name and the duration of the song as well.
4. Below the progress bar, we are setting the current song name and song cover.
5. Hovering on any song will make it a bit bold to understand which song are you in.

Hope you will enjoy using it [here](https://subhajit100.github.io/Spotify_clone/) :blush:
